# a-star-algorithm-visualizer

## What it is
This program creates a graphic visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm. The user is able to select a start and end point and create a maze of their own design in between the two points. The system will then find the shortest path to traverse the maze. 

## How to use it
Run `visualization.py` to start the program. Left click any square on the grid to select a start point, and left click a different square to set an end point. Once that is done, left click and hold the mouse to create black "barrier" squares to construct a maze. If you want to erase a square you've placed, right click that square.

Once you're done creating the maze, press spacebar to start the program. The computer will first create a map of red and green squares as it thinks through the solution. Once it is done generating red and green squares, press spacebar again and the computer will highlight the shortest possible path through purple squares. After the system is done, press 'c' to clear the grid and create a new maze.
